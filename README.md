Project Title: Retention Pulse - Employee Attrition Analysis

Project Description:

The Retention Pulse dashboard is a Power BI-based analytics tool designed to uncover the key drivers of employee attrition within a company. By analyzing workforce data, the project aims to identify patterns and insights that can help HR teams develop strategies to improve employee retention.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
	1.	Total Employee Count: The total number of employees analyzed in the dataset (1,413).
	2.	Attrition Count: The number of employees who have left the company (229).
	3.	Average Age: The average age of employees at the company (37 years), helping understand demographic trends in attrition.
	4.	Average Salary: The average monthly income of employees ($6.52K), providing insights into salary distribution and its impact on attrition.
	5.	Retention Rate (Years at Company): The average number of years employees stay with the company (7.04 years), indicating overall workforce stability.

Insights & Visualizations:
	•	Attrition by Education Field: Identifies which educational backgrounds experience higher attrition (e.g., Life Sciences 38%, Medical 25%).
	•	Attrition by Age Group: Highlights which age groups are most affected by employee turnover.
	•	Attrition by Salary Slab: Demonstrates how salary levels impact employee retention, showing that lower-income groups have higher attrition rates.
	•	Attrition by Job Role: Breaks down turnover rates by specific job roles, identifying positions with the highest exit rates (e.g., Laboratory Technicians, Sales Executives).
	•	Attrition by Years at Company: Shows how long employees typically stay before leaving, with a higher number of exits occurring within the early years.

Conclusion:

This project provides a data-driven approach to understanding workforce attrition and helps businesses take proactive steps to improve employee engagement, optimize compensation strategies, and enhance overall job satisfaction.
